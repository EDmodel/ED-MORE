## [Unreleased]

### Upgrading

- MEDS is now ED-MORE. The config files are `ed_config_main.toml`, `ed_config_pft.toml` and
  `ed_io_config.toml`, and output files start with `ED` instead of `meds`; config keys and output
  variables keep their names. The executable is `edmore` (was `meds_main`), the library
  `libedmore.so` (was `libmeds.so`), the CMake options `ED_*` (were `MEDS_*`), and source files and
  modules start with `ed_` (were `meds_`). (#4)

### Added

- The model from MEDS v0.4.0: its source, science documentation, CMake build and shipped data (the
  CO₂ record and an example census). Its output is bit-for-bit that of MEDS v0.4.0. (#4)
